# Unnamed Space Game
This is a FOSS 0x10C inspired game in Python

# How to Run
py -3.11 -m venv ./venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# How do I install this package?
If you made a change and want to use it directly in the game, go for Option 1. If you want a tested and approved update, use Option 2.

1. `pip install -e .` (Be sure that your fork and local clone is on the latest commit!)
2. `pip install git+https://github.com/Dark-Snake-Games/Dark-Snake-Engine`

Now you can use `import DSEngine` in **any** project!
